## L2 Norm Guided Adaptive Computation

This repo is the implementation of [L2 Norm Guided Adaptive Computation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=qW_GZYyn7C) in JAX.
Our paper introduces L2 Adaptive Computation (LAC), a new method that allows neural networks
to adapt their computational budget based per patch, example, or token level. LAC utilizes the
L2-norm of the modelâ€™s activations for making halting decisions, eliminating the need for extra
learnable parameters or auxiliary loss terms.
